            <h2>The Problem</h2>

            <p>I needed a portfolio site. Not a template. Not a WordPress theme. Something that actually reflected how I think about product work — the attention to detail, the iteration, the willingness to throw things away and start over.</p>

            <p>The problem: I'm a product manager. I've spent years in dashboards and roadmaps and stakeholder decks, not writing CSS. I know enough HTML to be dangerous and enough JavaScript to break things. Building something polished enough to show hiring managers felt like a multi-week side project I'd never finish.</p>

            <p>Then Anthropic released Cowork mode for Claude — essentially an AI agent that can browse the web, manage files, and operate your computer on your behalf. I decided to try building the entire site through conversation.</p>

            <h2>The First Conversation</h2>

            <p>I started with a simple prompt: build me a portfolio page. What came back was fine — clean, professional, the kind of thing you'd get from any template. White background, sans-serif font, card grid. It looked like every other portfolio on the internet.</p>

            <p>So I started pushing. What if the background had depth? What if the cards felt like frosted glass? What if the whole thing felt like looking through ice on a cold morning?</p>

            <p>That's when things got interesting. Claude didn't just apply a blur filter and call it done. It built a layered system — a gradient background with radial overlays, glass cards with tuned opacity and backdrop blur, borders that catch light. The kind of thing that takes a designer hours to get right, arrived in a single response.</p>

            <h2>Thirty Commits of Iteration</h2>

            <p>Building the site was not one conversation. It was thirty-plus commits over multiple sessions, each one a small refinement. The commit history tells the story better than I can:</p>

            <div class="glass-card rounded-xl p-5 my-6" style="font-family: 'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace; font-size: 0.82rem; line-height: 1.9; color: #4338ca;">
                Water-like momentum physics and floating animation<br>
                Fluid jelly physics with continuous squash/stretch<br>
                Add buttery smooth scroll with lerped momentum<br>
                Refine to gentle water-float motion, remove jelly distortion<br>
                Strip back all hover animations for complete stillness<br>
                Remove fade-in animations — cards are immediately present<br>
                Independent card movement, smooth settle to stillness
            </div>

            <p>See the pattern? I kept asking for motion, then pulling it back. Adding physics, then stripping it away. The scroll behavior alone went through five iterations — from aggressive jelly distortion to buttery lerped momentum to, ultimately, almost nothing. The final version has barely perceptible movement, which is exactly right.</p>

            <p>This is the part that surprised me. AI-assisted development isn't about getting it right the first time. It's about making iteration so cheap that you can explore ideas you'd never bother with otherwise. I tried scroll physics with momentum dampening. I tried cards that deform like jelly when you scroll past them. I tried ambient wave animations running in the background. All of these were bad ideas, and I found that out in minutes instead of days.</p>

            <h2>The Features That Stuck</h2>

            <p>After all that iteration, the site ended up with a few features I never would have attempted on my own:</p>

            <p><strong>Glassmorphism.</strong> Every card, overlay, and panel uses frosted-glass styling with calibrated opacity, backdrop blur, and layered borders. The background is a multi-stop gradient with radial overlays that give the whole page a sense of atmospheric depth. Getting the contrast right — readable text on translucent surfaces — took several rounds of tuning.</p>

            <p><strong>A built-in analytics dashboard.</strong> Not Google Analytics. A custom, privacy-friendly system that tracks page views, click events, and visitor patterns, all stored in localStorage. It renders behind a glassmorphic overlay with grid-based metrics. Is this overkill for a portfolio site? Absolutely. But it demonstrates something real about how I think about data.</p>

            <p><strong>An interactive guided tour.</strong> A spotlight-and-tooltip system that walks visitors through the site's content, highlighting key sections with a focused beam and explanatory cards. It locks scroll position and dims the background. The kind of feature you'd scope as a two-week sprint for a junior developer.</p>

            <p><strong>Charter typography.</strong> The entire site uses Charter — a serif face that reads well on screens and gives the content a more editorial feel than the standard sans-serif stack. It's a small choice that changes the whole tone of the page.</p>

            <h2>The Numbers</h2>

            <div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-8">
                <div class="stat-box">
                    <div class="stat-number">70K</div>
                    <div class="stat-label">Single HTML file</div>
                </div>
                <div class="stat-box">
                    <div class="stat-number">30+</div>
                    <div class="stat-label">Commits</div>
                </div>
                <div class="stat-box">
                    <div class="stat-number">0</div>
                    <div class="stat-label">Build tools</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The whole site is one HTML file. Seventy thousand characters of markup, styling, and JavaScript — no build step, no framework, no dependencies beyond Tailwind's CDN. You can view-source the entire thing. This wasn't the plan. It emerged from the process: each conversation added features to the same file, and at no point did the complexity justify splitting it up.</p>

            <p>Some people will look at a 70K single-file site and see a mess. I look at it and see a working product that shipped in days instead of weeks, runs everywhere, loads instantly, and has zero dependencies to maintain. The engineering purist in me cringes a little. The product manager in me recognizes that it works.</p>

            <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>

            <p>It wasn't all smooth. Injecting a 70K file through GitHub's web editor introduced UTF-8 encoding corruption — em dashes turned into mojibake, a closing script tag lost its angle bracket, and special characters doubled up into six-byte sequences. Debugging that required byte-level analysis of the file to find and replace every corrupted character.</p>

            <p>The GitHub Pages blog path also broke permanently. Files in the <code>/blog/</code> directory returned 404s no matter what I tried — Jekyll processing, custom workflows, <code>.nojekyll</code> flags. The fix was to give up and move everything to <code>/writing/</code> instead. Sometimes the right engineering decision is to walk away from the problem.</p>

            <h2>The Meta Question</h2>

            <p>There's something recursive about using an AI agent to build a portfolio that's meant to demonstrate your ability to ship products. Am I showing off my skills, or Claude's?</p>

            <p>I think the honest answer is: both, and that's the point. The value I brought wasn't writing CSS or JavaScript. It was knowing what to ask for, knowing when something looked wrong, knowing when to push further and when to pull back. I was the product manager and Claude was the engineering team. The commit history — thirty rounds of adding and removing and refining — is exactly what product development looks like. The tool just moved faster than any team I've worked with.</p>

            <p>If you're a product manager, a designer, or anyone else who thinks in systems but doesn't write code daily, this is what the near future looks like. The bottleneck isn't implementation anymore. It's taste.</p>
