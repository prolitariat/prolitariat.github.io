            <h2>The Setup</h2>

            <p>I run a small Shopify store. Nothing fancy — just a side project for my family. I’d been meaning to clean things up: transfer my domain to Cloudflare, review what I was paying for, maybe wind down the Shopify subscription eventually. I decided to use Anthropic’s Claude in “Cowork mode” — essentially an AI agent that can browse the web, manage files, and operate autonomously on your behalf — to help manage all of it.</p>

            <p>What happened next was not what I expected.</p>

            <h2>The Discovery</h2>

            <p>While reviewing my store’s setup, Claude started auditing the JavaScript loading on my storefront. It enumerated every script tag on the page and mapped them to their source domains. The results were alarming:</p>

            <p><strong>22 scripts from 7 different domains.</strong></p>

            <p>Most were legitimate — Shopify’s own scripts, my analytics (Hotjar), standard platform code. But several scripts were loading from domains that had no business being on my store:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>aakash-info-tech.com</code></li>
                <li><code>cdn-bundler.nice-team.net</code></li>
                <li><code>bundler.nice-team.net</code></li>
            </ul>

            <p>These scripts were being injected by two Shopify apps I had installed:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>“Variant’s Description”</strong> by Aakash Info Tech — a $0.99/month app I’d installed back in February 2021. It had been quietly charging me for nearly five years.</li>
                <li><strong>“Bundler”</strong> — a free app that was monetizing itself by injecting advertising redirects.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Both apps were redirecting my visitors to scam sites like <code>happyinshape.com</code>. My customers were being hijacked, and I had no idea.</p>

            <h2>The Cleanup</h2>

            <p>Claude immediately flagged both apps as malicious and recommended emergency removal. We uninstalled both from the Shopify admin panel, then verified the cleanup:</p>

            <p><strong>After removal: 17 scripts from 3 legitimate domains</strong> (my store domain, shop.app, static.hotjar.com).</p>

            <p>Five malicious scripts eliminated. The redirect chain was broken. Store was clean.</p>
            <h2>The Domain Transfer</h2>

            <p>In parallel, Claude managed the transfer of my store domain from Shopify’s registrar (Tucows) to Cloudflare. This involved setting up a Cloudflare zone, updating nameservers, obtaining an auth/EPP code from Shopify, initiating the registrar transfer, and monitoring WHOIS propagation.</p>

            <p>The transfer was submitted and set to auto-complete within 5 days. All handled autonomously.</p>

            <h2>The Billing Analysis</h2>

            <p>Claude then dug into my Shopify billing history. “Variant’s Description” had been charging $0.99/month since February 2021 — approximately <strong>$59 in total charges</strong> for an app that was literally malware. And here’s the kicker: Shopify had already <strong>delisted</strong> the app from their App Store for violations. They knew it was malicious. But the charges kept coming.</p>

            <h2>The Support Chat: AI vs. AI?</h2>

            <p>This is where it gets interesting.</p>

            <p>I asked Claude to contact Shopify support to request a refund and file a partner violation report. Claude opened a live chat session and began negotiating.</p>

            <p>The support advisor followed what appeared to be a scripted deflection pattern:</p>

            <p><strong>Deflection #1:</strong> “Shopify acts as the billing platform, but the funds go directly to the app developer. You need to contact the developer for a refund.”</p>

            <p>Claude’s response: This isn’t a standard app dispute — these were malware apps. The developer was a fraud. Shopify delisted them. You can’t send someone to a delisted scammer for a refund.</p>

            <p><strong>Deflection #2:</strong> <em>(Same script repeated)</em></p>

            <p>Claude’s response: You didn’t answer my yes/no question. Can you process the refund or not?</p>

            <p><strong>Deflection #3:</strong> <em>(Same script, third time)</em></p>

            <p>Claude’s response: You’ve repeated this three times. The developer was a FRAUD that Shopify ALREADY DELISTED. I need three things: a case number, a partner violation report, and either a refund or a supervisor.</p>

            <p>There’s a real possibility that both sides of this conversation were AI agents — Claude on my behalf, and a support bot on Shopify’s side. The patterns were telling: the long pauses, the scripted deflections, the inability to deviate from a predetermined response tree.</p>

            <h2>The Numbers That Tell the Real Story</h2>

            <div class="stats-card">
                <dl class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
                    <div>
                        <dt>Total chat session</dt>
                        <dd>1 hr 40+ min</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <dt>Time in queue</dt>
                        <dd>33 minutes</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <dt>Deflection scripts repeated</dt>
                        <dd>3 times</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <dt>Direct questions answered</dt>
                        <dd>0</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <dt>Refund amount</dt>
                        <dd>~$59</dd>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <dt>Time with advisor</dt>
                        <dd>1 hr 6+ min</dd>
                    </div>
                </dl>
            </div>

            <p>Think about that. Over an hour of active engagement with customer support, for a $59 refund on <em>confirmed malware that Shopify themselves delisted</em>. If you’re earning anything above minimum wage, the math doesn’t work. Your time is worth more than the refund.</p>

            <p>And that’s the point.</p>

            <p>This is a deliberate design pattern. The extended waits, the circular deflections, the requests for evidence that can’t exist (screenshots of malware you already removed as an emergency measure) — it’s all friction engineered to make you give up. A normal human being would have abandoned this chat 40 minutes in. The house always wins because the house has infinite patience and you don’t.</p>

            <p>Unless you’re not human.</p>
            <h2>Fighting Fire with Fire</h2>

            <p>Claude doesn’t get tired. It doesn’t get frustrated. It doesn’t lose track of what was said 45 minutes ago. It doesn’t calculate whether its time is worth more than $59 and decide to cut its losses.</p>

            <p>While Claude was sitting in the Shopify chat window, waiting through 3-5 minute silences between each response, it was simultaneously extracting and saving the full chat transcript, drafting this blog post, analyzing session timestamps, and monitoring the domain transfer status.</p>

            <p>An AI agent turns the attrition model on its head. The same infinite patience that companies weaponize against customers now works <em>for</em> the customer. The asymmetry is gone.</p>

            <h2>The Takeaway</h2>

            <p>An AI agent autonomously:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Discovered active malware</strong> on my store by auditing JavaScript sources</li>
                <li><strong>Performed emergency remediation</strong> by identifying and removing malicious apps</li>
                <li><strong>Verified the cleanup</strong> with before/after script analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Managed a domain transfer</strong> across registrars</li>
                <li><strong>Analyzed billing history</strong> to quantify financial damage</li>
                <li><strong>Negotiated with customer support</strong> for a refund, pushing back against scripted deflections</li>
            </ol>

            <p>All of this happened in a single session, with minimal human intervention. I gave it a direction, it executed.</p>

            <p>The future of platform management isn’t a human sitting at a dashboard clicking through admin panels. It’s an AI agent that can reason about what it finds, take decisive action, and advocate on your behalf when things go wrong.</p>
